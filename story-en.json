Motionless, she watches a fleeting spectacle: a school of silver fish glides past her, their scales shimmering under the sun's filtered rays. In a coordinated movement, the school suddenly pivots, stretching toward the underwater horizon. The diver remains suspended, a silent witness to this aquatic exodus, as the last fish disappear into the vastness.",
