    "about-p-1": "Sealens is a photographic exhibition about the Mediterranean Sea, which invites you to explore underwater landscapes and meet its inhabitants during the length of a breath-hold dive. Each dive tells a new story, delicately revealing the beauty and fragility of a world we never suspected. Let yourself be carried by the currents, observe with respect, and let the Mediterranean whisper its secrets.",
    "about-p-2": "Our project was born from a simple conviction: understanding to better protect. Each image is a testimony, each look an invitation to become aware of the richness and vulnerability of our maritime heritage. It's an ode to the Mediterranean, a visual journey that both awakens and amazes. Through our images, we seek to capture the essence of a world vibrant with life, shaped by thousands of years of history.",
